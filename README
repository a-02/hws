- This is Simon Marlow's HWS.  I'm just playing with it.

- build with Cabal as usual.

- There was a bug where you could access ../../../../etc/passwd.
  I added some path normalization code to Main.hs.
  I also had it strip ":"s from the path to avoid any streams and
  driver problems under win32 (if you happen to run it there.. not sure
  if it does run in win32 or not).

- It will happily follow symlinks out of the document root.  This isn't
  easily fixed.  I leave this one to the web server admin.

- The logging code isnt careful about data it logs.  It's possible
  to enclose quotes to confuse any post-processor.

- The code doesn't unquote the URL path it receives.

- added code to redirect /some/dir to /some/dir/.
- added code to list directory if index.html is not present
  - the code does not currently quote filenames.  This may
    lead to XSS attacks in some rare instances.
- added code to decode urls (ie %XX).
